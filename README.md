# TicTacToe

## Description

- The DebugDataBandits have created a Tic Tac Toe Game.
- This is a two-player game.
- The users utilize the mouse to click on the buttons on the Tic Tac Toe board to place their respective symbol, either an "X" or an "O".
- Whichever player places three of their symbols in a row, in a column, or diagonally wins the game.
- If neither player places three of their symbols in a row, in a column, or diagonally, a tie occurs.

## Controls

- Simply use the mouse to click on a button in order to place a symbol.
- Player 1 gets symbol "X", while Player 2 gets symbol "O".
- Once finished playing, simply close the Application Window.
- If a replay is desired, simply run the program again.
